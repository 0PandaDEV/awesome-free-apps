# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Guidelines

- Commit message of your pull request should be in the format `Add: x`, `Fix: y`, `Update: z`. Example: `Add: Winpower`
- App should be added in this format and it should be added to the bottom of the specific category:

```
- [NAME](LINK) - DESCRIPTION. ICONS FOR OS AND MORE
```

Example:

```
- [Winpower](https://github.com/Axorax/winpower) - Advanced power settings and management for Windows. ü™ü üü¢
```

- Description of the app should be short and only highlight the features. Don't include random nonsense like if your app falls under the "Clipboard Management" category and you write "Software to manage clipboard.", that provides no information about the app. <br><br> The description should end with a period (.), no other symbols like !, ?, etc. are allowed. <br><br> The description shouldn't start with words like "A", "The", etc. Example:

```
‚ùå A lightweight app to do something.
‚úÖ Lightweight app to do something.
```

- The icons (emojis) should go after the description. There is a reference table at the top of the README file.
